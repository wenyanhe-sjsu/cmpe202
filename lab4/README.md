CRC cards are presented in the pdf file named CRCcards.pdf.  So is the answer to
the question posed by the instructor.

I just realized that the instructor expected us to list CRC cards in the
README.md file.  As I am still trying to become familiar with creating a
markdown table for a README.md file, I can only submit my CRC cards in a pdf
file for now.
